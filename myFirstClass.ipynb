    "*Boring Definition:* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes modeling real-world entities as objects that have data (attributes) and behavior (methods) bundled together. OOP aims to make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain by structuring it around these objects and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Class`*: A blueprint or template that defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) of objects. It acts as a user-defined data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Object`*: Sometimes referred to an instance of a class, representing a specific entity with the defined attributes and behaviors. \n",

    " `str` and `int` are classes that defined the objects (or instances) called. "
